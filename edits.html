<h2>WHY GMAING ?</h2>
    <p2> so you might ask me why gaming is my hobby, well 
        since this pandamic begined i was unable to get out of my house and wander around.
        so i was looking an option to kill my time and the top results was gaming, this desicion also 
        gave me an advantage and that was to play with my friends online also i could creat my gaming rig and overclock it to push it's limts.
        
        Well since this hobby killed my bordem but latter on the game statrs to get old and not fun 
        so i did spend some money on buying games from the microsoft store and spent some money on my gaming rig tom upgrade it. 
        
        so yea this is the reason.
